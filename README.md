  ## Introduction:
  Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Vision 2030 aims to increase the population of Riyadh to ten million people. This makes the city an attractive place for job seekers and tourists, increasing the demand for apartments for sale or rent. This project aims to analyze apartment data in Riyadh to provide insights into their density and prices, helping to understand the housing market and guide investment and housing decisions.
